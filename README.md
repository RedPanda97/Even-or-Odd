# Simple Even or Odd checker

Hello! This program is a simple CLI tool to check weather a users input is an even or odd integer. It is written in Java and you'll need the Java JDK installed on your local machine to compile the .java file and then run it.

## Pre-Requirements:
1. You will need a version of the java JDK installed on your local machine. As the application is so simple, any version should be fine, but the latest (JDK 23) is recommended at time of writing.

## Steps to compile and run
1. Pull the latest version of this repo to your local machine
2. Navigate to the directory that you pull the repo to and run the following: ```javac .\OddEvenChecker.java ```
You will now have compiled the .java file and have generated a .class file.
3. Run ``` java OddEvenChecker ``` in the same dir
4. You are now running the program. Follow the prompts or enter 'exit' to quit the app.
